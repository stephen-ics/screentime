# 📦 Legacy SQL Files

This directory contains the old monolithic SQL files that have been replaced by the new modular structure.

## Files Moved

- **`setup-database.sql`** - The original monolithic setup file (15KB, 412 lines)
- **`fix-rls-policies.sql`** - RLS policy fixes

## Why They Were Replaced

The monolithic approach had several issues:

- ❌ **Hard to maintain** - Everything in one massive file
- ❌ **No version control** - Difficult to track changes
- ❌ **Poor organization** - Mixed concerns (tables, functions, policies)
- ❌ **Deployment confusion** - Unclear execution order
- ❌ **No modularity** - Can't run specific components

## New Structure Benefits

- ✅ **Modular organization** - Logical separation of concerns
- ✅ **Version controlled** - Proper migration system
- ✅ **Production ready** - Follows industry best practices
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Easy to update individual components
- ✅ **Documented** - Clear README and comments
- ✅ **Testable** - Can run components independently

## Migration Complete ✅

The new structure in `database/` provides:

1. **Organized modules** - schemas, functions, policies, indexes, etc.
2. **Main deployment script** - `database/deploy.sql`
3. **Comprehensive documentation** - `database/README.md`
4. **Maintenance tools** - Cleanup and monitoring functions
5. **Sample data** - Development seed data

## Use the New Structure

Instead of these legacy files, use:

```sql
-- Run the complete deployment
\i database/deploy.sql
```

See `database/README.md` for complete instructions.
